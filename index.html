                        <em>An award winner at HackUCI!</em> This site uses machine learning + facial recognition with face-api.js to detect your mood 
                        and generate a Spotify playlist to match using your preferred artists and genre. I trained an SVM model that takes song data
                        from Spotify's API and predicts the levels of happiness, sadness, and anger present in each song's tone.

                        <em>Top 10 at MIT's Data Hackathon!</em> This research project uses unsupervised topic modeling on social media platforms and 
                        media reports at-large to learn the priorities of public concerns relative to the number of COVID-19 cases and major developments.

                        As a member of the ICS Student Council at UCI, we're working on a comprehensive 4-year course planning tool that will help students
                        access professor reviews, course prerequisite trees, personal progress, and more all in one place. We are currently getting feedback
                        from alpha testing right now here!
